# Hello React

Create a simple `<Hello ${name}/>` component in React, and then pass the name as props between components.

## Prerequisites

- React
- Create-react-app

## Instructions

1. Create a react app called `hello-react` using `npx create-react-app hello-react` 
2. Change into the newly created project directory with `cd hello-react`.
3. Follow the requirements below.

## Requirements

For this exercise, you're going to build a `<Hello />` component that renders
some data passed in as props.

### Setup

Create a file called `Hello.js` in the `src/` directory.

### Function Component

Using a function, define a component called `Hello` that renders an `h1` with
the text `"Hello World"` in it. 

Update your `<App>` component so that it renders your new `Hello` component.

### Using the Props Object

Update your component so that it accepts a `name` property. Instead of rendering
`"Hello World"`, your `Hello` component should now render a message with the
value of `name`.

Update your `Hello` component in `App.js` so that you're passing in a name as
a prop.

### BONUS

Feeling ambitious? 

Copy the array below and paste it into your `App.js` file above the `App` function.

```js
const names = ['Eddie Van Halen', 'Jimi Hendrix', 'Wes Montgomery', 'Frank Zappa', 'John Mayer']
```

Using the `names` array, render a `Hello` component for each person in the array.



This is your chance to play with React before we move on to Hooks, use this as a sandbox to nest components, style them as you want (headers, footers, asides), and pass props down as much as you can.
